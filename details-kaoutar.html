            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>This project was created as part of my Master's program, showcasing our class of 2024-2025. But in this part, I'll be talking about myself:</p>
            <p>I am currently pursuing a Master's 2 in Computer Science at the University of Corsica, specialising in web and mobile development. In addition, I hold a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Algiers 1 in Algeria, which has provided me with a deep understanding of AI concepts and allowed me to gain significant hands-on experience in this rapidly evolving field.</p>
            <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have had the privilege of working on various projects that have strengthened my technical expertise. Notably, I contributed to the development of a recommendation system for scientific articles during my work placement at the Research Centre for Scientific and Technical Information in Algeria. Additionally, I was involved in the creation of multiple web applications, including an appointment management platform for a blood transfusion centre and a thesis recommendation website using artificial intelligence technologies.</p>
            <p>These experiences have helped me to refine my skills in key technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Node.js. Moreover, I have become proficient in database management using MySQL and MongoDB. With a solid foundation in both web development and artificial intelligence, I am eager to continue expanding my knowledge and making meaningful contributions in the tech industry.</p>
